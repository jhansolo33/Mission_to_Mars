###  How many months exist on Mars?

###  How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?

###  What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? To answer this question:
Find the average the minimum daily temperature for all of the months.
Plot the results as a bar chart.

###  Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? To answer this question:
Find the average the daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.
Plot the results as a bar chart.

###  About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? To answer this question:
Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.
Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.
